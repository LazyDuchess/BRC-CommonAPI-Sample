# CommonAPI Sample

This is an example project that utilizes [CommonAPI](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/BRC-CommonAPI) to add a new "Cheats" app to the phone, which allows you to fill up your boost charge, teleport to any stage and to set and go to custom respawn points for each stage which get automatically saved to your save slot.

## Building

Make sure you have a `BRCPath` environment variable defined on your system, which points to the root folder of your Bomb Rush Cyberfunk installation. This way the project can find the required DLLs.
